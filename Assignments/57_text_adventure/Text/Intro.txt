The city never sleeps. Neon lights flicker against the rain-slick streets, and the hum of traffic  
blends with murmured conversations in alleyways. This place is alive, but something feels off.  

For weeks now, people have been disappearing. No ransom notes, no crime scenes—just an eerie  
void where they used to be. The rumors are wild: secret experiments, a shadow cult, even  
creatures that stalk the streets after dark. You didn’t believe the stories. Not until someone  
you care about vanished.  

You stand in their empty apartment now, the air heavy with absence. On the table, an open  
notebook displays their scribbled notes about "The Passage" and a crumpled flyer advertising  
a secret underground club. Nearby, their phone buzzes with a single, cryptic text:  
"Meet me where the light fades."
